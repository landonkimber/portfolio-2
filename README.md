## 📖 Description

Welcome to the second iteration of my responsive, customizable, and static React portfolio! This application takes a scrollable approach to enhance engagement for mobile users, recognizing the prevalence of smartphone usage. At the bottom of the page, you'll discover a settings section showcasing various art/design styles, accessibility options, and a dynamic day/night mode.
