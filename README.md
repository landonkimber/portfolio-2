# React Portfolio Version 2

## Description

This is my second attempt at creating a responsive, customizable, static react portfolio! This application uses a scrollable approach to better engage mobile users as most people posses own and frequently use their smartphones. At the bottom of the page, you'll find a settings section that demonstrates multiple art/design styles, options for better accessibility, and a dynamic day/night mode.
